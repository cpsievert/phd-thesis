# Problem statement

> "[The web] has helped broaden the focus of statistics from the modeling stage to all stages of data science: finding relevant data, accessing data, reading and transforming data, visualizing the data in rich ways, modeling, and presenting the results and conclusions with compelling, interactive displays." - [@nolan-lang]

The web enables broad distribution and presentation of applied statistics products and research. Partaking often requires a non-trivial understanding of web technologies, unless a custom interface is designed for the particular task. The CRAN task views on [open data](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata) and [web services](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices) document such interfaces for the R language, the world's leading open source data science software [@RCore]. This monumental community effort helps R users make their work accessible, portable, and interactive.

R has a long history of serving as an interface to computational facilities for the use of people doing data analysis and statistics research. In fact, the motivation behind the birth of R's predecessor, S, was to provide a direct, consistent, and interactive interface to the best computational facilities already available in languages such as FORTRAN and C [@S:1978]. This empowers users to focus on the primary goal statistical modeling and exploratory data analysis, rather than the computational implementation details. By providing more and better interfaces to web services, we can continue to empower R users in a similar way, by making it easier to acquire and/or share data, create interactive web graphics and reports, distribute research products to a large audience in a portable way, and more generally, take advantage of modern web services.

Portability prevents the broad dissemination of statistical computing research, especially interactive statistical graphics. Interactive graphics software traditionally depend on toolkits like GTK+ or openGL that provide widgets for making interface elements, and also event loops for catching user input. These toolkits need to be installed locally on a user's computer, across various platforms, which adds to installation complexity, impeding portability. Modern web browsers with HTML5 support are now ubiquitous, and provide a cross-platform solution for sharing interactive statistical graphics. However, interfacing web-based visualizations with statistical analysis software remains difficult, and still requires juggling many languages and technologies. By providing better interfaces for creating web-based interactive statistical graphics, we can make them more accessible, and therefore make it easier to share statistical research to a wider audience. This research addresses this gap.

Reproducibility requires that user events such as menu selections or mouse clicks and drags are recorded to be replayed later. Some of this was solved by using recording devices making videos to be shared on the web (e.g. \cite{ASA video library}).

# Overview

This section describes the background and an overview of my research on making web-based interactive graphics and data on the web more accessible. I currently maintain a number of software projects (including 7 different R packages) that address this common theme. It also points to my plans for completing my thesis research.

## The importance of interface design

Unwin and Hofmann [-@Unwin:1999vp] discuss the strengths, weaknesses, and differences between using graphical and command-line interfaces for data analysis. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) can be much more intuitive to use, but at the cost of being less flexible, precise, and repeatable. Unwin and Hofmann argue statistical software should strive to achieve a synergy of two that leverages both of their strengths. That is, a command-line interface when we can precisely describe what we want and a graphical interface for "searching for information and interesting structures without fully specified questions."

Unwin and Hofmann further discuss the different audiences these interfaces attract. Command-line interfaces typically attract "power users" such as applied statisticians and statistical researchers in a university, whereas more casual users of statistical software typically prefer a GUI. In later sections, we discuss GUIs in greater detail within the context of interactive statistical graphics. For now, we briefly discuss some best practices for designing a command-line interface for statistical computing in R.

Before authoring an interface, one should establish the target audience, the class of problems it should address, and loosely define how the interface should actually work. During this process, it may also be helpful to identify your audience as being primarily composed of _software developers_ or _data analysts_. Developers are typically more interested in using the interface to develop novel software or incorporating the functionality into a larger scientific computing environment [@embedded-computing]. In this case, interactive exploration and troubleshooting is not always a luxury, so robust functionality is of utmost importance. On the other hand, analysts interfaces should work well in an interactive environment since this caters to rapid prototyping of ideas and troubleshooting of errors.

Good developer interfaces often make it easier to implement good analyst interfaces. A great recent example of a good developer interface is the R package __Rcpp__, which provides a seamless interface between R with C++ [@Rcpp]. To date, more than 500 R packages use __Rcpp__ to make interfaces that are both expressive and efficient, including the highly influential analyst interfaces such as __tidyr__ and __dplyr__ [@tidy-data]; [@dplyr]. These interfaces help analysts focus on the primary task of wrangling data into a form suitable for visualization and statistical modeling, rather than focusing on the implementation details behind how the transformations are performed. [@Donoho:2015tu] argues that these interfaces "May have more impact on todayâ€™s practice of data analysis than many highly-regarded theoretical statistics papers".

 TODO:
* Difficulty in evaluating interfaces?
* Purely functional programming?
* Compatible interfaces (S3)?

Evaluating statistical computing interfaces is certainly a subjective matter since we all have different tastes, different backgrounds, and have different needs. It seems reasonable to evaluate an interface based on its effectiveness and efficiency in aiding a user complete their task, but as [@Unwin:1999vp] points out, "There is a tendency to judge software by the most powerful tools they provide (whether with a good interface or not)". As a result, all too often, analysts must spend time gaining the skills of a software developer. Good analyst interfaces often abstract functionality from developer interfaces in a way that allow analysts to focus on their primary task of acquiring/analyzing/modeling/visualizing data, rather than the implementation details. The following focuses on such work with respect to acquiring data from the web and interactive statistical web graphics.

## Interfaces for working with web content

R has a rich history of interfacing with web technologies for accomplishing a variety of tasks such as requesting, manipulating, and creating web content. As an important first step, extending ideas from [@Chambers:1999], Brian Ripley implemented the connections interface for file-oriented input/output in R [@Connections]. This interface supports a variety of common transfer protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP), providing access to most files on the web that can be identified with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Connection objects are actually external pointers, meaning that, instead of immediately reading the file, they just point to the file, and make no assumptions about the actual contents of the file.

Many functions in the base R distribution for reading data (e.g., `scan`, `read.table`, `read.csv`, etc.) are built on top of connections, and provide additional functionality for parsing well-structured plain-text into basic R data structures (vector, list, data frame, etc.). However, the base R distribution does not provide functionality for parsing common file formats found on the web (e.g., HTML, XML, JSON). In addition, the standard R connection interface provides no support for communicating with web servers beyond a simple HTTP GET request [@Lang:2006us].

The __RCurl__, __XML__, and __RJSONIO__ packages were major contributions that drastically improved our ability to request, manipulate, and create web content from R [@nolan-lang]. The __RCurl__ package provides a suite of high and low level bindings to the C library libcurl, making it possible to transfer files over more network protocols, communicate with web servers (e.g., submit forms, upload files, etc.), process their responses, and handle other details such as redirects and authentication [@RCurl]. The __XML__ package provides low-level bindings to the C library libxml2, making it possible to download, parse, manipulate, and create XML (and HTML) [@XML]. To make this possible, __XML__ also provides some data structures for representing XML in R. The __RJSONIO__ package provides a mapping between R objects and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [@RJSONIO]. These packages were heavily used for years, but several newer interfaces have made these tasks easier and more efficient.

The __curl__, __httr__, and __jsonlite__ packages are more modern R interfaces for requesting content on the web and interacting with web servers. The __curl__ package provides a much simpler interface to libcurl that also supports streaming data (useful for transferring large data), and generally has better performance than __RCurl__ [@curl]. The __httr__ package builds on __curl__ and organizes it's functionality around HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.) [@httr]. Since most web application programming interfaces (APIs) organize their functionality around these same verbs, it is often very easy to write R bindings to web services with __httr__. The __httr__ package also builds on __jsonlite__ since it provides consistent mappings between R/JSON and most most modern web APIs accept and send messages in JSON format [@jsonlite]. These packages have already had a profound impact on the investment required to interface R with web services, which are useful for many things beyond data acquisition. For example, it is now easy to install R packages hosted on the web (__devtools__), perform cloud computing (__analogsea__), and archive/share computational outputs (__dvn__, __rfigshare__, __RAmazonS3__, __googlesheets__, __rdrop2__, etc.).

The __rvest__ package builds on __httr__ and makes it easy to manipulate content in HTML/XML files [@rvest]. Using __rvest__ in combination with [SelectorGadget](http://selectorgadget.com/), it is often possible to extract structured information (e.g., tables, lists, links, etc) from HTML with almost no knowledge/familiarity with web technologies. The __XML2R__ package has a similar goal of providing an interface to acquire and manipulate XML content into tabular R data structures without any working knowledge of XML/XSLT/XPath [@Sievert:2014a]. As a result, these interfaces reduce the startup costs required for analysts to acquire data from the web.

Packages such as __XML__, __XML2R__, and __rvest__ can download and parse the source of web pages, which is _static_, but extracting _dynamic_ web content requires additional tools. The R package __rdom__ fills this void and makes it easy to render and access the Document Object Model (DOM) using the headless browsing engine phantomjs [@rdom]. The R package __RSelenium__ can also render dynamic web pages and simulate user actions, but its broad scope and heavy software requirements make it harder to use and less reliable compared to __rdom__ [@RSelenium]. __rdom__ is also designed to work seamlessly with __rvest__, so that one may use the `rdom()` function instead of `read_html()` to render, parse, and return the DOM as HTML (instead of just the HTML page source).

Any combination of these R packages may be useful in acquiring data for personal use and/or providing a higher-level interface to specific data source(s) to increase their accessibility. The next section focuses on such interfaces.

## Interfaces for acquiring data on the web

The web provides access to the world's largest repository of publicly available information and data. This provides a nice _potential_ resource both teaching and practicing applied statistics, but to be practical useful, it often requires a custom interface to make data more accessible. If publishers follow best practices, a custom interface to the data source usually is not needed, but this is rarely the case. Many times structured data is embedded within larger unstructured documents, making it difficult to incorporate into a data analysis workflow. This is especially true of data used to inform downstream web applications, typically in XML and/or JSON format. There are two main ways to make such data more accessible: (1) package, document, and distribute the data itself (2) provide functionality to acquire the data.

If the data source is fairly small, somewhat static, and freely available with an open license, then we can directly provide data via R packaging mechanism. In this case, it is best practice for package authors include scripts used to acquire, transform, and clean the data. This model is especially nice for both teaching and providing examples, since users can easily access data by installing the R package. [@rpkgs] provides a nice section outlining the details of bundling data with R packages.[^13]

[^13]: This section is freely available online <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html>.

R packages that just provide functionality to acquire data can be more desirable than bundling it for several reasons. In some cases, it helps avoid legal issues with rehosting copyrighted data. Furthermore, the source code of R packages can always be inspected, so users can verify the cleaning and transformations performed on the data to ensure its integrity, and suggest changes if necessary. They are also versioned, which makes the data acquisition, and thus any downstream analysis, more reproducible and transparent. It is also possible to handle dynamic data with such interfaces, meaning that new data can be acquired without any change to the underlying source code. As explained in [Taming PITCHf/x Data with XML2R and pitchRx](#taming-pitchfx-data-with-xml2r-and-pitchrx), this is an important quality of the __pitchRx__ R package since new PITCHf/x data is made available on a daily basis.

Perhaps the largest centralized effort in this domain is lead by [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org), a community of R developers that, at the time of writing, maintains more than 50 packages providing access to scientific data ranging from bird sightings, species occurrence, and even text/metadata from academic publications. This provides a tremendous service to researchers who want to spend their time building models and deriving insights from data, rather than learning the programming skills necessary to acquire and clean it.

It's becoming increasingly clear that "meta" packages that standardize the interface to data acquisition/curation in a particular domain would be tremendously useful. However, it is not clear how such interfaces should be designed. The R package __etl__ is one step in this direction and aims to provide a standardized interface for _any_ data access package that fits into an Extract-Transform-Load paradigm [@etl]. The package provides generic `extract`-`transform`-`load` functions, but requires package authors to write custom `extract`-`transform` methods for the specific data source. In theory, the default `load` method works for any application; as well as other database management operations such as `update` and `clean`.

## Dynamic interactive statistical web graphics

### Why interactive?

Unlike computer graphics which focuses on representing reality, virtually, data visualization is about garnering abstract relationships between multiple variables from visual representation. The dimensionality of data, the number of variables can be anything, usually more than 3D, which summons a need to get beyond 2D canvasses for display. Technology enables this, enabling the user to see many views, query and link components. Dynamic, interactive graphics permits a user to get beyond the constraints of low-dimensional displays to see into high-dimensional relationships in data.

Dynamic interactive statistical graphics is useful for descriptive statistics, and also to help build better inferential models. Any statistician is familiar with diagnosing a model by plotting data in the model space (e.g., residual plot, qqplot). This works well for determining if the assumptions of a model are adequate, but rarely suggests that our model neglects important features in the data. To combat this problem, [@Wickham:2015ur] suggest that we should plot the model in the data space and use dynamic interactive statistical graphics to do so. Interactive graphics have also proved to be useful for exploratory model analysis, a situation where we have many models to evaluate, compare, and critique [@Unwin:2003uy]; [@Urbanek:2004]; [@Ripley:2004]; [@Unwin:2006]; [@Wickham:2007wq]. With such power comes responsibility that we can verify that visual discoveries are real, and not due to random chance [@Buja:2009hp]; [@Majumder:2013ie].

The ASA Section on Statistical Computing and Graphics maintains a video library which captures many useful dynamic interactive statistical graphics techniques. Several videos show how xgobi (predecessor to ggobi), a dynamic interactive statistical graphics system, can be used to reveal high-dimensional relationships and structures that cannot be easily identified using numerical methods alone [@xgobi].[^1] Another notable video shows how the interactive graphics system mondrian can be used to quickly find interesting patterns in high-dimensional data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques [@mondrianbook].[^2] The most recent video, which shows how dynamic interactive techniques can be used to help interpret a topic model (a statistical mixture model applied to text data) using __LDAvis__ [@Sievert:2014b], is the first web-based visualization in the library, and can be viewed in Figure \ref{fig:LDAvis}.

[^2]: <http://stat-graphics.org/movies/tour-de-france.html>

In order to be practically useful, interactive statistical graphics must be fast, flexible, accessible, portable, and reproducible. In general, over the last 20-30 years interactive graphics systems were fast and flexible, but were also not easily accessible, portable, or reproducible. The web provides the tool to combat these problems. For example, any visualization created with __LDAvis__ can be shared through a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), meaning that anyone with a web browser and an internet connection can view and interact with a visualization. Furthermore, we can link anyone to any possible state of the visualization by encoding selections with a URL fragment identifier. This makes it possible to link readers to an interesting state of a visualization from an external document, while still allowing them to independently explore the same visualization and assess conclusions drawn from it.[^4]

### Indirect versus direct manipulation

Even within the statistical graphics community, the term _interactive_ graphics can mean wildly different things to different people [@swayne-klinke]. Some early statistical literature on the topic uses interactive in the sense that an interactive command-line prompt allows users to create graphics on-the-fly [@S:1984]. That is, users enter commands into the command-line prompt, the prompts evaluates the command, and prints the result (known as the readâ€“evalâ€“print loop (REPL)). Modifying a command to generate another variation of a particular result (e.g., to restyle a static plot) can be thought of as a type of interaction that some might call _indirect manipulation_.

Indirect manipulation can be achieved both from the command-line or from a graphical user interface (GUI). Indirect manipulation from the command-line is more flexible since we have complete control over the commands, but it is also more cumbersome since we must translate our thoughts into code. Indirect manipulation via a GUI is more restrictive, but it helps reduces the the gulf of execution for end-users (i.e., easier to generate desired output) [@Hutchins:1985wu]. In this sense, a GUI can be useful, even for experienced programmers, when the command-line interface impedes our primary task of deriving insight from data. 

In many cases, the gulf of execution can be further reduced through direct manipulation. Roughly speaking, within the context of interactive graphics, direct manipulation occurs whenever we interact with a plot and reveal new information tied to the event. [@ggobi:2007] use the terms dynamic graphics and direct manipulation to characterize "plots that respond in real time to an analyst's queries and change dynamically to re-focus, link to information from other sources, and re-organize information." Perhaps the most powerful direct manipulation technique is the paradigm of linked views [@Wilhelm:2005], which will be discussed in more detail in a later section.

<!-- TODO
Maybe tourring video here?
-->

A simple example to help demonstrate the differences between these interactive techniques would be in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) via multiple boxplots. By default, most plotting libraries sort categories alphabetically, but this is usually not optimal for visual comparison of groups. With a static plotting library such as __ggplot2__, we could indirectly manipulate the default by going back to the command-line, reordering the factor levels of the categorical variables, and regenerate the plot [@ggplot2]. This is flexible and precise since we may order the levels by any measure we wish (e.g., Median, Mean, IQR, etc.), but it would be much quicker and easier if we had a GUI with a drop-down menu for most of the reasonable sorting options. In a general purpose interactive graphics system such as mondrian, we can use direct manipulation to directly click and drag on the categories to reorder them, making it quick and easy to compare any two groups of interest [@mondrianbook].

### Linked views and pipelines

A general purpose interactive statistical graphics system should possess many direct manipulation techniques such as identifying (i.e., mousing over points to reveal labels), focusing (i.e., view size adjustment, pan and zoom), brushing/identifying, etc. However, it is the intricate management of information across multiple views of data in response to user events that is most valuable. Extending ideas from [@viewing-pipeline], [@plumbing] point out that any visualization system with linked views must implement a data pipeline. That is, a "central commander" must be able to handle interaction(s) with a given view, translate its meaning to the data space, and update any linked view(s) accordingly. In order to do so, the commander must know, and be able to compute, function(s) from data to visual space, as well as from visual space to the data. Implementing a pipeline that is fast, general, and able to handle statistical transformations is incredibly difficult. Unfortunately, literature on the implementation of such pipelines is virtually non-existent, but [@Xie:2014co] provides a nice overview of the implementation details in the R package __cranvas__ [@cranvas].

### Web graphics

Thanks to the constant evolution and eventual adoption of HTML5 as a web standard, the modern web browser now provides a viable platform for building an interactive statistical graphics systems. HTML5 refers to a collection of technologies, each designed to perform a certain task, that work together in order to present content in a web browser. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a convention for managing all of these technologies to enable _dynamic_ and _interactive_ web pages. Among these technologies, there are several that are especially relevant for interactive web graphics: 

1. HTML: A markup language for structuring and presenting web content.
2. SVG: A markup language for drawing scalable vector graphics.
3. CSS: A language for specifying styling of web content.
4. JavaScript: A language for manipulating web content.

Juggling all of these technologies to just create a simple statistical plot is a tall order. Thankfully, HTML5 technologies are publicly available, and benefit from thriving community of open source developers and volunteers. In the context of web-based visualization, the most influential contribution is Data Driven Documents (D3), a JavaScript library which provides high-level semantics for binding data to web content (e.g., SVG elements) and orchestrating scene updates/transitions [@Bostock:2011]. D3 is wildly successful because is builds upon web standards, without abstracting them away, which fosters customization and interoperability. However, compared to a statistical graphics environments like R, creating basic charts is complicated, and a large amount of code must be hard-wired to each visualization. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to provide higher-level interfaces to web graphics, and we focus on R interfaces.

### Translating R graphics to the web

There are a few ways to simply translate R graphics to a web format, such as SVG. R has built-in support for a SVG graphics device, made available through the `svg()` function, but it can be quite slow, which inspired the new __svglite__ package [@svglite]. The __SVGAnnotation__ package provides some functionality to post-process SVG files generated with `svg()` to add some basic interactivity and animation [@SVGAnnotation].  The __gridSVG__ package is specially designed to translate __grid__ graphics (e.g., __ggplot2__, __lattice__, etc.) to SVG, and preserves the naming information of grid objects, making it easier to layer on interactive functionality [@gridSVGreport]. [@vdmR] uses __gridSVG__ to enable linked brushing between __ggplot2__ graphics, but only implements a few chart types. [@svgPanZoom] uses __gridSVG__ to provide pan and zoom capability to virtually any R graphic. 

<!--
[@plotROC] uses __gridSVG__ as well
-->

The __animint__ and __plotly__ packages take a different approach to translating __ggplot2__ graphics to a web format [@animint]; [@plotly]. Instead of translating directly to SVG via __gridSVG__, they extract relevant information from the internal representation of a __ggplot2__ graphic[^5], store it in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and pass the JSON as input to a JavaScript function, which then produces a web based visualization. It is becoming more and more popular to see JavaScript graphing libraries use this design pattern (sometimes referred to as a JSON specification or schema), since it separates out _what_ is information contained in the the graphic from _how_ to actually draw it. This has a number of advantages; for example, __plotly__ graphics can be rendered in SVG, or using WebGL (based on HTML5 canvas, not SVG) which allows the browser to render many more graphical marks by leveraging the GPU.

[^5]: For a visual display of the internal representation used to render a __ggplot2__ graph, see my __shiny__ app here <http://104.131.111.111:3838/ggtree/>.

Converting static graphics to web formats such as SVG or canvas not only allows us to embed the graphics into larger HTML documents, but it also allows us to inject basic interactive features at no cost to the user. For example, in __animint__ and __plotly__ we provide tool-tips and clickable legends that show/hide graphical marks corresponding to the legend entry.[^6] In the case of __animint__, we have also extended __ggplot2__ grammar of graphics to enable animations and categorical linking between plots with relatively small amount of effort by users. This extension is discussed at length in [Two new keywords for interactive, animated plot design: clickSelects and showSelected](#two-new-keywords-for-interactive-animated-plot-design-clickSelects-and-showSelected)

### Creating interactive web graphics from R

Translating existing graphics to a web-based format is useful for quickly breathing new life into existing code, but it is fairly limited in how far we can take it. Assuming the goal is to have a general, yet high-level, interface for creating highly dynamic interactive web graphics from R, we're better off designing a new grammar exactly for this purpose. The first serious attempt in this direction was the R package __rCharts__, whose R interface is heavily inspired by __lattice__ [@rCharts]. The most impressive result of __rCharts__'s design is its ability to interface with many different JavaScript charting libraries. However, __rCharts__ has little to no support for coordination of linked views from R.

Another popular interface for creating interactive web graphics from R is __ggvis__, a reworking of ggplot2's grammar of graphics to incorporate interactivity [@ggvis]. Similar to __animint__, __ggvis__ encodes plot specific information as JSON, but instead of writing a JavaScript renderer from the ground up, it uses Vega, a popular JSON schema for creating web-based graphics [@vega]. This limits the flexibility of __ggvis__, but it also drastically reduces the overhead in maintaining such a software project, allowing the focus to be on building a grammar for expressing interactions from R. 

The current version of __ggvis__ uses an old version of vega, before support for reactive components was added to its JSON schema. To implement its interactive features, __ggvis__ currently uses a mix of custom JavaScript and  __shiny__ functionality. As a result, in order to view a __ggvis__ visualization, one often needs access to a __shiny__ server, which impedes portability.[^6] It is plausible that, in the future, __ggvis__ will leverage vega's new reactive components wherever possible, so that some visualizations can render entirely client-side, which enhances portability and performance.

[^6]: The <http://www.shinyapps.io/> service helps to provide easy access to a shiny server, so that shiny apps can be shared via a URL, for example: <https://hadley.shinyapps.io/14-ggvis/linked-brushing.Rmd>

Although it increases computational overhead, there are still scenarios where a web application (client-server approach) is more desirable than web pages that render entirely client-side. For example, an interactive visualization might need to dynamically perform statistical computations which are easy to program in R, but difficult in JavaScript. [@FastRWeb] and [@opencpu] also allow us to execute and retrieve R output from from a web browser via HTTP, but __shiny__ is the most heavily used since apps can be written entirely in R using a very powerful, yet approachable, reactive programming framework for handling user events. There are also many convenient shortcuts for creating attractive HTML input forms, making it incredibly easy to go from R script to an web app powered by R that dynamically updates when users alter input values. In other words, __shiny__ makes it quick and easy to write web-based GUIs with support for indirect manipulation.

Historically, it has required an advanced understanding of __shiny__ and JavaScript to enable direct manipulation, but recently, support was added for triggering callbacks when users interact with R graphics (via `plotOutput()`) and/or arbitrary images (via `imageOutput()`) inside a __shiny__ app. These special input bindings allow shiny app developers to build arbitrary direct manipulation functionality on top of base and __ggplot2__ graphics with little to no JavaScript knowledge.[^7] Although these input bindings can not be used to retrieve information about interaction with other graphical output, their selections can be sent to update other views.[^8] This is useful, but it can also be useful to send selections from one arbitrary view to another arbitrary view.

[^7]: This example from the shiny gallery demonstrates how to access this information -- <http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/plot-interaction-basic.html>

[^8]: An example of brushing a `plotOutput()` graphic (in this case a __ggplot2__ graphic) to update the view of another graphic (in this case a __plotly__ graphic) <http://104.131.111.111:3838/brush2plotly/> (source code here -- <https://github.com/cpsievert/shiny_apps/blob/master/brush2plotly/app.R>)

Many JavaScript charting libraries have appeared since the advent of __rCharts__, making a centralized package for interfacing with _every_ library infeasible. Many ideas deriving from work on __rCharts__, such as providing the glue to render plots in various contexts (e.g., the R console, shiny apps, and __rmarkdown__ documents), evolved into the R package __htmlwidgets__ [@htmlwidgets]. Having built similar bridges for __animint__ and __LDAvis__, I personally know and appreciate the amount of time and effort this package saves other package authors. 

The __htmlwidgets__ framework is not constrained to just graphics, it simply provides a set of conventions for authoring web content from R. Numerous JavaScript data visualization libraries are now made available using this framework, most designed for particular use cases, such as __leaflet__ for geo-spatial mapping, __dygraphs__ for time-series, and __networkD3__ for networks [@leaflet]; [@dygraphs]; [@networkD3].[^9] There are also HTML widgets that provide an interface to more general purpose visualization JavaScript libraries such as __plotly__, __rbokeh__, and __rcdimple__ [@plotly]; [@rbokeh]; [@rcdimple]. Most of these JavaScript libraries provide at least some native support for direct manipulation such as implement some type identifying (i.e., mousing over points to reveal labels), focusing (i.e., pan and zoom), and sometimes highlighting (i.e., brushing over points to highlight points in another view). Again, more often than not, the support for coordinating views is lacking, especially if we want to control coordination from R. 

[^9]: For more examples and information, see <http://www.htmlwidgets.org/> and <http://hafen.github.io/htmlwidgetsgallery/>

The R package __crosstalk__ is a brand new framework for authoring coordinated HTML widgets (TODO: citation). It provides both an R and a JavaScript API for tracking user selections, meaning __crosstalk__ powered HTML widgets can work with or without __shiny__, and if implemented correctly by HTML widget authors, provides a means for sharing user selections between HTML widgets. As of right now, __crosstalk__ essentially just provides ways to get and set user selections, so the actual data pipeline for implementing linked views must be handled by the HTML widget author, which is far from trivial. [@d3scatter] demonstrates how __crosstalk__ can be used to author an HTML widget for linked brushing[^10], but it is not yet clear how to implement pipelines where the function between the data and visual marks something other than the identity function. __plotly__ also has some support for sharing click events[^11], with support for brush events coming soon.

[^10]: See, for example, <http://rpubs.com/jcheng/crosstalk-demo>
[^11]: See, for example, <http://bl.ocks.org/cpsievert/raw/560fcbbe8846d6af6413/>

Having HTML widgets that can share selections will be a huge step forward for web-based interactive graphics. With some effort and careful implementation by HTML widget authors, it may be possible to provide sensible defaults for updating views between arbitrary widgets, but users that know some JavaScript should be able change these defaults from R. In time, the __htmlwidget__ package will provide conventions for this, by allowing one to send arbitrary JavaScript functions from R that execute after the widget has rendered in the browser. The biggest problem in implementing coordinated widgets will be in managing data structures, since each widget will likely have its own data structure for representing a selection. In this case, in order to coordinate them, users may have to embed widgets in a shiny app to access and organize selections. This gives users tremendous control over sharing selections, but may limit control over smooth transitions between states of a given widget, a quality that is essential for dynamic graphics.

### New challenges

As interactive graphics become more accessible and portable, they are being used more and more for presentation, rather than just a tool for discovery used by experts. Nowhere is this more evident than at major news outlets like the New York Times and The UpShot, where interactive graphics are constantly used in web publications to encourage readers to explore data that supplement a narrative. There are some exceptions to the rule[^12], but all too often, these graphics ignore measures of uncertainty, and instead focus on conveying the most amount of information is the most effective way possible. To some degree, this highlights the difference in goals between the statistical graphics and InfoVis communities [@Gelman:2013et].

[^12]: This report does a good job of demonstrating uncertainty in the Labor Department's monthly jobs report using dynamic interactive graphics <http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/upshot/how-not-to-be-misled-by-the-jobs-report.html>

* How to handle multiple, concurrent users?
  > opencpu and FastRWeb enjoy better overall performance compared to shiny since R sessions are stateless.

* What is missing is something akin to the mutaframe (__mutatr__?), that can work entirely client-side (inside the browser), but can also easily integrate with an R server framework (e.g. __shiny__). 


<!--
Functional programming paradigm works well for computational problems with well defined input/output. With interactive web graphics you want to the output to be dynamic, meaning that users can modify the "inputs" even after the output has been determined.

<!--
Numerous JavaScript charting libraries provide wrappers around D3 to simplify certain charts, but these wrappers are rarely designed with multiple linked views in mind. A few notable exceptions are the JavaScript libraries [crossfilter.js](https://github.com/square/crossfilter) and [dc.js](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js).
These libraries allow for coordinated linked views, but require a heavy amount of JavaScript code, are limited to a predefined set of chart types, and do not support many statistical computations.

### GUI Toolkits

A wide array of GUI toolkits have been available in R for years, and many of them interface to GUI construction libraries written in lower-level languages. A couple fairly recent and popular examples include the __RGtk2__ package which provides R bindings to the GTK+ 2.0 library written C and the __rJava__ package which provides R bindings to Java [@RGtk2]; [@rJava]. More recently, GUI development has moved to the web browser. Probably the most attractive consequence of writing a GUI for the web browser is that users do not have to install any software in order to use the interface. 
-->


<!-- TODO

Historically, open source interactive graphics software is often hard to install and practically impossible to distribute to a wider audience. The web browser provides a viable solution to this problem, as sharing an interactive graphics (and even a specific _state_ of the visualization) can be as easy as sharing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The web browser doesn't come without some restrictions; however, since it is impossible to maintain the state of multiple windows, a fundamental characteristic of most interactive graphics software. Fortunately, we can still produce linked views by putting multiple plots in a single window.
-->


<!-- TODO: WHERE DOES THIS GO????

In addition to adding infrastructure for testing __animint__'s renderer, I've made a number of other contributions:

1. Wrote bindings for embedding __animint__ plots inside of knitr/rmarkdown/shiny documents, before the advent of __htmlwidgets__, which provides standard conventions for writing such bindings [@htmlwidgets]. At the time of writing, __htmlwidgets__ can only be rendered from the R console, the R Studio viewer, and using R Markdown (v2). For this reason, we decide to not use __htmlwidgets__ since users may want to incorporate this work into a different workflow. 

2. Wrote `animint2gist`, which uploads an __animint__ visualization as a GitHub gist, which allows users to easily share the visualizations with others via a URL link.

3. Implemented __ggplot2__ facets (i.e., `facet_wrap` and `facet_grid`) as well as the fixed coordinate system (i.e., `coord_fixed`).

4. Mentored and assisted Kevin Ferris during his 2015 Google Summer of Code project where he implemented theming options (i.e., `theme`), legend interactivity, and selectize widgets for selecting values via a drop-down menu.

When I started on __plotly__, it's core functionality and philosophy was very similar to __animint__: create interactive web-based visualizations using __ggplot2__ syntax [@plotly]. However, plotly's `JavaScript` graphing library supports chart types and certain customization that __ggplot2__'s syntax doesn't support. Realizing this, I initiated and designed a new domain-specific language (DSL) for using plotly's `JavaScript` graphing library from R. Although it's design is inspired by __ggplot2__'s `qplot` syntax, the DSL does not rely on __ggplot2__, which is desirable since its functionality won't break when __ggplot2__ internals change.

plotly's 'native' R DSL is heavily influenced by concepts deriving from pure functional programming. The output of a pure function is completely determined by its input(s), and because we don't need any other context about the state of the program, it easy to read and understand the intention of any pure function. When a suite of pure functions are designed around a central object type, we can combine these simple pieces into a pipeline to solve complicated tasks, as is done in many popular R packages such as __dplyr__, __tidyr__, __rvest__, etc [@pipelines].

__plotly__'s pure functions are deliberately designed around data frames so we can conceptualize a visualization as a pipe-able sequence of data transformations, model specifications, and mappings from the data/model space to visual space. With the R package __ggvis__ [@ggvis], one can also mix data transformation and visual specifications in a single pipeline, but it does so by providing S3 methods for __dplyr__'s generic functions, so all data transformations in a __ggvis__ pipeline have to use these generics. By directly modeling visualizations as data frames, __plotly__ removes this restriction that transformation must derive from a generic function, and removes the burden of exporting transformation methods on its developers.

__plotly__ even respects transformations that remove attributes used to track visual properties and data mappings. To demonstrate, in the example below, we plot the raw time series with `plot_ly()`, fit a local polynomial regression with `loess()`, obtain the observation-level characteristics of the model with `augment()` from the __broom__ package, layer on the fitted values to the original plot with `add_trace()`, and add a title with `layout()`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(broom)
economics %>%
  transform(rate = unemploy / pop) %>%
  plot_ly(x = date, y = rate, name = "raw") %>%
  loess(rate ~ as.numeric(date), data = .) %>%
  augment() %>%
  add_trace(y = .fitted, name = "smooth") %>%
  layout(title = "Proportion of U.S. population that is unemployed")
```

![](plotly.png)

To make this possible, a special environment within __plotly__'s namespace tracks not only visual mappings/properties, but also the order in which they are specified. So, if a __plotly__ function used to modify a visualization (e.g., `add_trace()` or `layout()`) receives a data frame without any special attributes, it retrieves the last plot created, and modifies that plot. 

__animint__ and __plotly__ could be classified as general purpose software for web-based interactive and dynamic statistical graphics; whereas __LDAvis__, could be classified as software for solving a domain specific problem. The __LDAvis__ package creates an interactive web-based visualization of a topic model fit to a corpus of text data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to assist in interpretation of topics. The visualization itself is written entirely with HTML5 technologies and makes use of the `JavaScript` library d3js [@Bostock:2011] to implement advanced interaction techniques that higher-level tools such as __plotly__, __animint__, and/or __shiny__ do not currently support.

# Scope

This section describes work to be achieved before completion of the thesis. Most of the work involves writing, revising, and submitting papers. I have a very early start on two papers that will summarize modern interfaces in R for interactive web graphics as well as curating data on the web.

In February 2015, I was invited to write a chapter on MLB Pitching Expertise and Evaluation for the Handbook of Statistical Methods for Design and Analysis in Sports, a volume that is planned to be one of the Chapman & Hall/CRC Handbooks of Modern Statistical Methods. I've since brought on Brian Mills as a co-author, and we submitted a draft in early November. This chapter uses data collection and visualization functionality in the __pitchRx__ package, but it more focused on modeling this data with Generalized Additive Models. The book likely won't be published until after this thesis is completed, and the chapter probably won't be included in the thesis, but I do intend on working on revisions of this chapter in the meantime.

Toby Dylan Hocking, Susan VanderPlas, and I have a paper in progress which outlines the design of __animint__ and it's interesting features <https://github.com/tdhock/animint-paper/>. We've submitted this paper to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, and were told to revise and resubmit. We intend on revising and submitting to the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics by January 2016. The revision includes a restructuring of the content/ideas and new features implemented during Google Summer of Code 2015. The paper will be included as one of the chapters in my thesis.

As of writing, I'm working on numerous bug fixes in __plotly__, introduced by a massive reworking of __ggplot2__ internals in version 1.1. I intended on making similar fixes for __animint__ so users can rely on the CRAN version of __ggplot2__, rather than [our outdated fork of ggplot2](https://github.com/tdhock/animint). This work simply ensures packages are _usable_, but I'd also like to work on novel features. Currently the most interesting, and most valuable addition would be adding more __crosstalk__ support in plotly to enable linked views.

# Taming PITCHf/x Data with XML2R and pitchRx

Pitch f/x refers a massive, publicly available baseball dataset hosted on the web in XML and JSON format. Since this data is large, increases on a daily basis, and only licensed for individual use, the __pitchRx__ package provides a simple interface to download, parse, clean, and transform the data from its source (instead of directly distributing the data). If acquiring large amounts of data, to avoid memory limitations, users may divert incoming data in chunks to a database using any valid R database connection [@DBI]. It also provides a convenient function to update an existing database with the most recently available data without re-downloading anything.

The __openWAR__ package also provides high-level access to Pitch f/x data, but it is currently more limited in the data it can acquire [@openWAR]. It also currently depends on the difficult to install __Sxslt__ package, impeding portability [@Sxslt]. __openWAR__ depends on __Sxslt__ to help transform XML files to R data frames via XSL Transformations (XSLT). Without advanced knowledge of XSLT, one must define transformations by hard coding assumptions about the XML format, such as the names of fields of interest. New variables have been added into Pitch f/x several times, and __pitchRx__ automatically picks them up, thanks to functionality provided by __XML2R__.

__XML2R__ makes it easy to wrangle relational data stored as a collection of XML files into a list of data frames. Its interface satisfies principles from pure functional programming: the output of each function can be completely determined from the input. The interface is also predictable: each function inputs and outputs a list of observations (an observation is a matrix with one row). It also represents XML content as a list of observations (matrices with one row), allowing each function to operate on native R data structures, making it more intuitive for R programmers to work with compared to the non-native XMLDocumentContent. This new representation is slightly less computationally efficient in some cases, but it has also made it much easier to implement and maintain higher-level interfaces to specific XML data sources, such as __pitchRx__ and __bbscrapeR__ [@bbscrapeR].

# Curating open data in R

Work in progress that will likely build on the overview and provide examples of curating data in R.

# LDAvis: A method for visualizing and interpreting topics

The R package __LDAvis__ creates an interactive web-based visualization of a topic model that has been fit to a corpus of text data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Given the estimated parameters of the topic model, it computes various summary statistics as input to a reusable interactive visualization built with HTML, JavaScript, and D3. The goal is to help users interpret the topics in their LDA topic model, and the interactive visualization is primarily useful for quickly viewing, altering, and tracking changes in rankings of terms for a given topic.

In a topic model, each topic is defined by a probability mass function over each unique term in the corpus. When studying their differences, analysts often look at lists of the top (say 30) terms of a topic ranked by the estimated probability within that given topic. As discussed in the video below and in our paper, this makes it hard to differentiate meaning between topics since words that are likely to appear overall are also likely to appear in a given topic. Instead, we propose ranking terms using a compromise between this probability and lift (probability within topic divided by overall probability). We also conduct a user study which provides evidence that this compromise helps in identifying topics, and propose a sensible starting point for choosing a compromise; but in practice, users will want to adjust this value and understand how rankings are affected. For this reason, it is important that we assist users in their ability to track changes, by using smooth transitions from one ranking to the next.

# Two new keywords for interactive, animated plot design: clickSelects and showSelected

This paper explains the clickSelects/showSelected paradigm, implemented in __animint__, which makes it easy to select/query points belonging to arbitrary group(s) and visualize those points in another data space. This differs from the classical linked brushing approach where points must belong to contiguous regions within a subset of the data space.

# Web-based interactive statistical graphics

Work in progress that will likely build on the overview and provide examples of cross-communication between HTML widgets.

# Testing HTML widgets from R

The current trend in testing HTML widget R packages is to verify that certain R commands construct an expected data structure. However, since this data structure has to be converted to JSON, and input into a JavaScript function(s), this approach doesn't guarantee that the end result is correct. Some HTML widgets use JavaScript libraries with their own testing framework, but if those tests change, R package authors may be oblivious to errors when upgrading to a new version. A proper testing framework for this type of software should be able to programmatically ensure that R commands create the correct web content, which involves constructing, parsing, and possibly manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).

HTML widgets that don't change based on user events will only have to construct and parse the DOM, so an R package like __rdom__ would be suitable for implementing tests. HTML widgets that do change based on user events will need to program these events using something like __RSelenium__.  I know first-hand from work on __animint__ that integrating __RSelenium__ with a unit testing framework such as __testthat__ is not trivial, so the community could benefit from a detailed explanation of the approach.
