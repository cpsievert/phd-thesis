# Problem statement

> "[The web] has helped broaden the focus of statistics from the modeling stage to all stages of data science: finding relevant data, accessing data, reading and transforming data, visualizing the data in rich ways, modeling, and presenting the results and conclusions with compelling, interactive displays." - [@nolan-lang]

The web enables broad distribution and presentation of applied statistics products and research. Partaking often requires a non-trivial understanding of web technologies, unless a custom interface is designed for people doing data analysis and statistics. The CRAN task views on [open data](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata) and [web services](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices) document such interfaces for the R language, the world's leading open source data science software [@RCore]. This monumental community effort helps R users make their work accessible, portable, and interactive.

R has a long history of serving as an interface to computational facilities for the use by people doing data analysis and statistics research. In fact, the motivation behind the birth of R's predecessor, S, was to provide a direct, consistent, and interactive interface to the best computational facilities already available in languages such as FORTRAN and C [@S:1978]. This empowers users to focus on the primary goal statistical modeling and exploratory data analysis, rather than the computational implementation details. By providing more and better interfaces to web services, we can continue to empower R users in a similar way, by making it easier to acquire and/or share data, create interactive web graphics and reports, distribute research products to a large audience in a portable way, and more generally, take advantage of modern web services.

Portability has prevented the broad dissemination of statsitical computing research, especially interactive statistical graphics. Interactive graphics software traditionally depend on toolkits like GTK+ or openGL that provide widgets for making interface elements, and also event loops for catching user input. These toolkits need to be installed locally on a user's computer, across various platforms, which adds to installation complexity, impeding portability. Modern web browsers with HTML5 support are now ubiquitous, and provide a cross-platform solution for sharing interactive statistical graphics. However, interfacing web-based visualizations with statistical analysis software remains difficult, and still requires juggling many languages and technologies. By providing better interfaces for creating web-based interactive statistical graphics, we can make them more accessible, and therefore make it easier to share statistical research to a wider audience. This research addresses this gap. 

<!--
Reproducibility requires that user events such as menu selections or mouse clicks and drags are recorded to be replayed later. Some of this was solved by using recording devices making videos to be shared on the web (e.g. \cite{ASA video library}).

# Overview

This section describes the background and an overview of my research on making web-based interactive graphics and data on the web more accessible. I currently maintain a number of software projects (including 7 different R packages) that address this common theme. It also points to my plans for completing my thesis research.

## The importance of interface design

Unwin and Hofmann [-@Unwin:1999vp] discuss the strengths, weaknesses, and differences between using graphical and command-line interfaces for data analysis. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) can be much more intuitive to use, but at the cost of being less flexible, precise, and repeatable. Unwin and Hofmann argue statistical software should strive to achieve a synergy of two that leverages both of their strengths. That is, a command-line interface when we can precisely describe what we want and a graphical interface for "searching for information and interesting structures without fully specified questions."

Unwin and Hofmann further discuss the different audiences these interfaces attract. Command-line interfaces typically attract "power users" such as applied statisticians and statistical researchers in a university, whereas more casual users of statistical software typically prefer a GUI. In later sections, we discuss GUIs in greater detail within the context of interactive statistical graphics. For now, we briefly discuss some best practices for designing a command-line interface for statistical computing in R.

Before authoring an interface, one should establish the target audience, the class of problems it should address, and loosely define how the interface should actually work. During this process, it may also be helpful to identify your audience as being primarily composed of _software developers_ or _data analysts_. Developers are typically more interested in using the interface to develop novel software or incorporating the functionality into a larger scientific computing environment [@embedded-computing]. In this case, interactive exploration and troubleshooting is not always a luxury, so robust functionality is of utmost importance. On the other hand, analysts interfaces should work well in an interactive environment since this caters to rapid prototyping of ideas and troubleshooting of errors.

Good developer interfaces often make it easier to implement good analyst interfaces. A great recent example of a good developer interface is the R package __Rcpp__, which provides a seamless interface between R with C++ [@Rcpp]. To date, more than 500 R packages use __Rcpp__ to make interfaces that are both expressive and efficient, including the highly influential analyst interfaces such as __tidyr__ and __dplyr__ [@tidy-data]; [@dplyr]. These interfaces help analysts focus on the primary task of wrangling data into a form suitable for visualization and statistical modeling, rather than focusing on the implementation details behind how the transformations are performed. [@Donoho:2015tu] argues that these interfaces "May have more impact on today’s practice of data analysis than many highly-regarded theoretical statistics papers".

 TODO:
* Difficulty in evaluating interfaces?
* Purely functional programming?
* Compatible interfaces (S3)?

Evaluating statistical computing interfaces is certainly a subjective matter since we all have different tastes, different backgrounds, and have different needs. It seems reasonable to evaluate an interface based on its effectiveness and efficiency in aiding a user complete their task, but as [@Unwin:1999vp] points out, "There is a tendency to judge software by the most powerful tools they provide (whether with a good interface or not)". As a result, all too often, analysts must spend time gaining the skills of a software developer. Good analyst interfaces often abstract functionality from developer interfaces in a way that allow analysts to focus on their primary task of acquiring/analyzing/modeling/visualizing data, rather than the implementation details. The following focuses on such work with respect to acquiring data from the web and interactive statistical web graphics.

## Interfaces for working with web content

R has a rich history of interfacing with web technologies for accomplishing a variety of tasks such as requesting, manipulating, and creating web content. As an important first step, extending ideas from [@Chambers:1999], Brian Ripley implemented the connections interface for file-oriented input/output in R [@Connections]. This interface supports a variety of common transfer protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP), providing access to most files on the web that can be identified with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Connection objects are actually external pointers, meaning that, instead of immediately reading the file, they just point to the file, and make no assumptions about the actual contents of the file.

Many functions in the base R distribution for reading data (e.g., `scan`, `read.table`, `read.csv`, etc.) are built on top of connections, and provide additional functionality for parsing well-structured plain-text into basic R data structures (vector, list, data frame, etc.). However, the base R distribution does not provide functionality for parsing common file formats found on the web (e.g., HTML, XML, JSON). In addition, the standard R connection interface provides no support for communicating with web servers beyond a simple HTTP GET request [@Lang:2006us].

The __RCurl__, __XML__, and __RJSONIO__ packages were major contributions that drastically improved our ability to request, manipulate, and create web content from R [@nolan-lang]. The __RCurl__ package provides a suite of high and low level bindings to the C library libcurl, making it possible to transfer files over more network protocols, communicate with web servers (e.g., submit forms, upload files, etc.), process their responses, and handle other details such as redirects and authentication [@RCurl]. The __XML__ package provides low-level bindings to the C library libxml2, making it possible to download, parse, manipulate, and create XML (and HTML) [@XML]. To make this possible, __XML__ also provides some data structures for representing XML in R. The __RJSONIO__ package provides a mapping between R objects and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [@RJSONIO]. These packages were heavily used for years, but several newer interfaces have made these tasks easier and more efficient.

The __curl__, __httr__, and __jsonlite__ packages are more modern R interfaces for requesting content on the web and interacting with web servers. The __curl__ package provides a much simpler interface to libcurl that also supports streaming data (useful for transferring large data), and generally has better performance than __RCurl__ [@curl]. The __httr__ package builds on __curl__ and organizes it's functionality around HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.) [@httr]. Since most web application programming interfaces (APIs) organize their functionality around these same verbs, it is often very easy to write R bindings to web services with __httr__. The __httr__ package also builds on __jsonlite__ since it provides consistent mappings between R/JSON and most most modern web APIs accept and send messages in JSON format [@jsonlite]. These packages have already had a profound impact on the investment required to interface R with web services, which are useful for many things beyond data acquistion. For example, it is now easy to install R packages hosted on the web (__devtools__), perform cloud computing (__analogsea__), and archive/share computational outputs (__dvn__, __rfigshare__, __RAmazonS3__, __googlesheets__, __rdrop2__, etc.).

The __rvest__ package builds on __httr__ and makes it easy to manipulate content in HTML/XML files [@rvest]. Using __rvest__ in combination with [SelectorGadget](http://selectorgadget.com/), it is often possible to extract structured information (e.g., tables, lists, links, etc) from HTML with almost no knowledge/familiarity with web technologies. The __XML2R__ package has a similar goal of providing an interface to acquire and manipulate XML content into tabular R data structures without any working knowledge of XML/XSLT/XPath [@Sievert:2014a]. As a result, these interfaces reduce the startup costs required for analysts to acquire data from the web.

Packages such as __XML__, __XML2R__, and __rvest__ can download and parse the source of web pages, which is _static_, but extracting _dynamic_ web content requires additional tools. The R package __rdom__ fills this void and makes it easy to render and access the Document Object Model (DOM) using the headless browsing engine phantomjs [@rdom]. The R package __RSelenium__ can also render dynamic web pages and simulate user actions, but its broad scope and heavy software requirements make it harder to use and less reliable compared to __rdom__ [@RSelenium]. __rdom__ is also designed to work seamlessly with __rvest__, so that one may use the `rdom()` function instead of `read_html()` to render, parse, and return the DOM as HTML (instead of just the HTML page source).

Any combination of these interfaces may be useful in developing high-level interfaces to specific web services or acquiring content for analysis. 

## Interfaces for acquiring data on the web

The web provides access to the world's largest repository of publicly available information and data. If publishers follow best practices, a custom interface to the data source usually is not needed, but this is rarely the case. Many times structured data is embeded within larger unstrucured documents, making it difficult to incorporate into a data analysis workflow. This is especially true of data used to inform downstream web applications, typically in XML and/or JSON format. There are two main ways to make such data more accessible: (1) package, document, and distribute the data itself (2) provide functionality to acquire the data.

<!--
These high-level interfaces provide a nice resource for both teaching and practicing applied statistics, and serve as a model for providing access to clean versions of messy datasets on the web [@Unwin:2010]. 
-->


If the data source is fairly small, somewhat static, and freely available with an open license, then we can directly provide data via R packaging mechanism. In this case, it is best practice for package authors include scripts used to acquire, transform, and clean the data. This model is especially nice for both teaching and providing examples, since users can easily access data by installing the R package.

R packages that just provide functionality to acquire data can be more desirable than repackaging the data for several reasons. In some cases, it helps avoid legal issues with rehosting copyrighted data. Furthermore, the source code of R packages can always be inspected, so users can verify the cleaning and transformations performed on the data to ensure its integrity. They are also versioned, which makes the data acquisition, and thus any downstream analysis, more reproducible and transparent. It is also possible handle dynamic data with such interfaces, meaning that new data can be acquired without any change to the underlying source code.

Perhaps the largest centralized effort in this direction is lead by [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org), a community of R developers that, at the time of writing, maintains more than 50 packages providing access to scientific data ranging from bird sightings, species occurrence, and even text/metadata from academic publications. This provides a tremendous service to researchers who want to spend their time building models and deriving insights from data, rather than learning the programming skills necessary to acquire and clean it.

It's becoming increasingly clear that "meta" packages that standardize the interface to data acquisition/curation in a particular domain would be tremendously useful. However, it is not clear how such interfaces should be designed. The __etl__ package (a joint work with Ben Baumer) is one step in this direction and actually aims to provide a standardized interface for _any_ data access package that fits into an Extract-Transform-Load paradigm [@etl]. The package provides generic `extract`-`transform`-`load` functions, but requires developers to write custom `extract`-`transform` methods for the specific data source. In theory, the default `load` method works for any application; as well as other database management operations such as `update` and `clean`.

## Dynamic interactive statistical web graphics

### Why interactive?

Our ability to find interesting structures in high-dimensional data is fundamentally limited by the 2D display of a computer screen (or paper). We can visualize a handful of dimensions by encoding data values in the visual attributes of marks on a static plot, but this approach often limited by perceptual issues when viewers try to decode values. There are also certain layouts, such as a scatterplot-matrix, and non-orthogonal coordinate systems (e.g., parallel coordinate plots), which allow us to see view high-dimensional relationships, but don't scale well to many variables and/or many observations. There are also many ways to perform dimension reduction (e.g., multidimensional scaling), but this can lead to over-generalizations that miss interesting details in the data. In short, any visualization of high dimensional data has to be compressed in some way, but interactivity allows us to obtain details-on-demain and reveal structure that may otherwise go unnoticed.

Dynamic interactive statistical graphics is not only useful for descriptive statistics, but they also provide tools to help build better inferential models. Any statistician is familiar with diagnosing a model by plotting data in the model space (e.g., residual plot, qqplot). This works well for determining if the assumptions of a model are adequate, but rarely suggests that our model neglects important features in the data. To combat this problem, [@Wickham:2015ur] suggest that we should plot the model in the data space and use dynamic interactive statistical graphics to do so. Interactive graphics have also proved to be useful for exploratory model analysis, a situation where we have many models to evaluate, compare, and critique [@Unwin:2003uy]; [@Ripley:2004]; [@Unwin:2006]; [@Urbanek:06]; [@Wickham:2007wq]. With such power comes responsibility that we can verify that visual discoveries are real, and not due to random chance [@Buja:2009hp]; [@Majumder:2013ie].

The ASA Section on Statistical Computing and Graphics maintains a video library which captures many useful dynamic interactive statistical graphics techniques. Several videos show how xgobi (predecessor to ggobi), a dynamic interactive statistical graphics system, can be used to reveal high-dimensional relationships and structures that cannot be easily identified using numerical methods alone [@xgobi].[^1] Another notable video shows how the interactive graphics system mondrian can be used to quickly find interesting patterns in high-dimensional data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques [@mondrianbook].[^2] The most recent video is the first web-based visualization and shows how interactive techniques can be used to help interpret a topic model (a statistical mixture model applied to text data) using __LDAvis__ [@Sievert:2014b].[^3]

[^2]: <http://stat-graphics.org/movies/tour-de-france.html>
[^3]: <http://stat-graphics.org/movies/ldavis.html>

In order to be practically useful, interactive statistical graphics must be fast, flexible, accessible, portable, and reproducible. In general, over the last 20-30 years interactive graphics systems were fast and flexible, but were also not easily accessible, portable, or reproducible. Web-based visualization provides the tools to combat these problems. For example, any visualization created with __LDAvis__ can be shared through a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), meaning that anyone with a web browser and an internet connection can view and interact with a visualization. Furthermore, we can link anyone to any possible state of the visualization by encoding selections with a URL fragment identifier. This makes it possible to link readers to an interesting state of a visualization from an external document, while still allowing them to independently explore the same visualization and assess conclusions drawn from it.[^4]

### Indirect versus direct manipulation

Even within the statistical graphics community, the term _interactive_ graphics can mean wildly different things to different people [@swayne-klinke]. Some early statistical literature on the topic uses interactive in the sense that an interactive command-line prompt allows users to create graphics on-the-fly [@S:1984]. That is, users enter commands into the command-line prompt, the prompts evaluates the command, and prints the result (known as the read–eval–print loop (REPL)). Modifying a command to generate another variation of a particular result (e.g., to restyle a static plot) can be thought of as a type of interaction that some might call _indirect manipulation_.

Indirect manipulation can be achieved both from the command-line or from a graphical user interface (GUI). Indirect manipulation from the command-line is more flexible since we have complete control over the commands, but it is also more cumbersome since we must translate our thoughts into code. Indirect manipulation via a GUI is more restrictive, but it helps reduces the the gulf of execution for end-users (i.e., easier to generate desired output) [@Hutchins:1985wu]. In this sense, a GUI can be useful, even for experienced statistical programmers, when the command-line interface impedes our primary task of deriving insight from data. 

In many cases, the gulf of execution can be further reduced through direct manipulation. Roughly speaking, within the context of interactive graphics, direct manipulation occurs whenever we interact with a plot and reveal new information tied to the event. [@ggobi:2007] use the terms dynamic graphics and direct manipulation to characterize "plots that respond in real time to an analyst's queries and change dynamically to re-focus, link to information from other sources, and re-organize information." Perhaps the most powerful direct manipulation technique is the paradigm of linked views [@Wilhelm:2005], which will be discussed in more detail in a later section.

A simple example to help demonstrate the differences between these interactive techniques would be in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) via multiple boxplots. By default, most plotting libraries sort categories alphabetically, but this is usually not optimal for visual comparison of groups. With a static plotting library such as __ggplot2__, we could indirectly manipulate the default by going back to the command-line, reordering the factor levels of the categorical variables, and regenerate the plot [@ggplot2]. This is flexible and precise since we may order the levels by any measure we wish (e.g., Median, Mean, IQR, etc.), but it would be much quicker and easier if we had a GUI with a drop-down menu for most of the reasonable sorting options. In a general purpose interactive graphics system such as mondrian, we can use direct manipulation to directly click and drag on the categories to reorder them, making it quick and easy to compare any two groups of interest [@mondrianbook].

### Linked views and pipelines

A general purpose interactive statistical graphics system should possess many direct manipulation techniques such as identifying (i.e., mousing over points to reveal labels), focusing (i.e., view size adjustment, pan and zoom), brushing/identifying, etc. However, it is the intricate management of information across multiple views of data in response to user events that is most valuable. Extending ideas from [@viewing-pipeline], [@plumbing] point out that any visualization system with linked views must implement a data pipeline. That is, a "central commander" must be able to handle interaction(s) with a given view, translate its meaning to the data space, and update corresponding view(s) accordingly. Implementing a pipeline that is fast, general, and able to handle statistical transformations is incredibly difficult. Unfortunately, literature on the implementation of such pipelines is virtually non-existent, but [@Xie:2014co] provides a nice overview of the implementation details in the R package __cranvas__ [@cranvas].

### Interactive web graphics

Thanks to the constant evolution and eventual adoption of `HTML5` as a web standard, the modern web browser now provides a viable platform for building an interactive statistical graphics systems. `HTML5` refers to a collection of technologies, each designed to perform a certain task, that work together in order to present content in a web browser. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a convention for managing all of these technologies to enable _dynamic_ and _interactive_ web pages. Among these technologies, there are several that are especially relevant for interactive web graphics: 

1. HTML: A markup language for structuring and presenting web content.
2. SVG: A markup language for drawing vector based graphics.
3. CSS: A language for specifying styling of web content.
4. JavaScript: A language for manipulating web content.

Juggling all of these technologies to just create a simple statistical plot is a tall order. Thankfully, `HTML5` technologies are publicly available, and benefit from thriving community of open source developers and volunteers. In the context of web-based visualization, the most influential contribution is Data Driven Documents (D3), a JavaScript library which provides high-level semantics for binding data to web content (e.g., `SVG` elements) and orchestrating scene updates/transitions [@Bostock:2011]. D3 is wildly successful because is builds upon web standards, without abstracting them away, which fosters customization and interopability. However, compared to a statistical graphics environment like R, creating basic charts is incredibly complicated. 

Numerous JavaScript charting libraries provide wrappers around D3 to simplify certain charts, but these wrappers are rarely designed with multiple linked views in mind. A few exceptions are the JavaScript libraries crossfilter.js and ...
These libraries allow for sophicated coordinated linked views, but requires a heavy amount of JavaScript code, and doesn't support many statistical computations. 

Talk about declarative vega?

### Interfacing interactive web graphics with R

The end goal is to allow R users to create fairly standard interactive graphics from R, 

What is missing is something akin to the mutaframe (__mutatr__?), that can work entirely client-side (inside the browser), but can also easily integrate with an R server framework (e.g. __shiny__). 




<!--
### GUI Toolkits

A wide array of GUI toolkits have been available in R for years, and many of them interface to GUI construction libraries written in lower-level languages. A couple fairly recent and popular examples include the __RGtk2__ package which provides R bindings to the GTK+ 2.0 library written C and the __rJava__ package which provides R bindings to Java [@RGtk2]; [@rJava]. More recently, GUI development has moved to the web browser. Probably the most attractive consequence of writing a GUI for the web browser is that users do not have to install any software in order to use the interface. 
-->

The R package __shiny__ makes it incredibly easy to create web-based GUIs with support for indirect manipulation [@shiny]. Since __shiny__ is based on a client-server model, it is sometimes referred to as a web application (app) framework. In a client-server model, end-users interact with the client, and when necessary, the client can requests resources from the server, or even request that the some code, that can't evaluated in a web browser (e.g., R code), be evaluated and its output returned to the client. There are a number of other R packages that allow one to write web apps which leverage R functionality (e.g., __FastRWeb__, __httpuv__, __opencpu__) [@FastRWeb], but __shiny__ is probably the most popular since apps can be written entirely in R using a very powerful yet approachable reactive programming framework for handling user events. There are also many convenient shortcuts for creating attractive HTML input widgets, making it incredibly easy to go from R script to an interactive web app powered by R.

Although it is very easy to write a __shiny__ app with indirect manipulation, it is often much harder to construct a web app with multiple coordinated, linked views. A myriad of JavaScript charting libraries have appeared in recent years which make it easy to perform simple direct manipulation such as identifying (i.e., mousing over points to reveal labels) and focusing (i.e., pan and zoom). Thanks to packages such as __htmlwidgets__, this functionality is now easy to embed inside a shiny app, but much harder to compose multiple linked views.

### Web Technologies

The __htmlwidgets__ package provides a framework for creating HTML widgets that render in various contexts including the R console, 'R Markdown' documents, and 'Shiny' web applications [@htmlwidgets]. (TODO: use this a transition point for moving to GUI/shiny applications?)

Functional programming paradigm works well for computational problems with well defined input/output. With interactive web graphics you want to the output to be dynamic, meaning that users can modify the "inputs" even after the output has been determined.



### New challenges

* How to handle multiple, concurrent users?
  > opencpu and FastRWeb are more performant since R sessions are stateless.

<!-- TODO

With the rise of the web browser (and in particular `HTML5` technologies), like it or not, the role of interactive graphics is generally shifting from discovery to presentation. Nowhere is this more evident than at major news outlets like the New York Times and The UpShot, where interactive graphics are constantly used in web publications, to allow readers to explore data that supplement a narrative. There are some [exceptions to the rule](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/upshot/how-not-to-be-misled-by-the-jobs-report.html), but all too often, these graphics ignore measures of uncertainty, and instead focus on conveying the most amount of information is the most effective way possible. To some degree, this highlights the difference in goals between the statistical graphics and InfoVis communities [@Gelman:2013et].

Historically, open source interactive graphics software is often hard to install and practically impossible to distribute to a wider audience. The web browser provides a viable solution to this problem, as sharing an interactive graphics (and even a specific _state_ of the visualization) can be as easy as sharing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The web browser doesn't come without some restrictions; however, since it is impossible to maintain the state of multiple windows, a fundamental characteristic of most interactive graphics software. Fortunately, we can still produce linked views by putting multiple plots in a single window.
-->




### A grammar for linked views

The clickSelects/showSelected paradigm makes it easy to select/query points belonging to arbitrary group(s) and visualize those points in another data space. This differs from the classing linked brushing approach where points must belong to contiguous regions within a subset of the data space.

<!-- TODO

WHERE DOES THIS GO????

In addition to adding infrastructure for testing __animint__'s renderer, I've made a number of other contributions:

1. Wrote bindings for embedding __animint__ plots inside of knitr/rmarkdown/shiny documents, before the advent of __htmlwidgets__, which provides standard conventions for writing such bindings [@htmlwidgets]. At the time of writing, __htmlwidgets__ can only be rendered from the R console, the R Studio viewer, and using R Markdown (v2). For this reason, we decide to not use __htmlwidgets__ since users may want to incorporate this work into a different workflow. 

2. Wrote `animint2gist`, which uploads an __animint__ visualization as a GitHub gist, which allows users to easily share the visualizations with others via a URL link.

3. Implemented __ggplot2__ facets (i.e., `facet_wrap` and `facet_grid`) as well as the fixed coordinate system (i.e., `coord_fixed`).

4. Mentored and assisted Kevin Ferris during his 2015 Google Summer of Code project where he implemented theming options (i.e., `theme`), legend interactivity, and selectize widgets for selecting values via a drop-down menu.

When I started on __plotly__, it's core functionality and philosophy was very similar to __animint__: create interactive web-based visualizations using __ggplot2__ syntax [@plotly]. However, plotly's `JavaScript` graphing library supports chart types and certain customization that __ggplot2__'s syntax doesn't support. Realizing this, I initiated and designed a new domain-specific language (DSL) for using plotly's `JavaScript` graphing library from R. Although it's design is inspired by __ggplot2__'s `qplot` syntax, the DSL does not rely on __ggplot2__, which is desirable since its functionality won't break when __ggplot2__ internals change.

plotly's 'native' R DSL is heavily influenced by concepts deriving from pure functional programming. The output of a pure function is completely determined by its input(s), and because we don't need any other context about the state of the program, it easy to read and understand the intention of any pure function. When a suite of pure functions are designed around a central object type, we can combine these simple pieces into a pipeline to solve complicated tasks, as is done in many popular R packages such as __dplyr__, __tidyr__, __rvest__, etc [@pipelines].

__plotly__'s pure functions are deliberately designed around data frames so we can conceptualize a visualization as a pipe-able sequence of data transformations, model specifications, and mappings from the data/model space to visual space. With the R package __ggvis__ [@ggvis], one can also mix data transformation and visual specifications in a single pipeline, but it does so by providing S3 methods for __dplyr__'s generic functions, so all data transformations in a __ggvis__ pipeline have to use these generics. By directly modeling visualizations as data frames, __plotly__ removes this restriction that transformation must derive from a generic function, and removes the burden of exporting transformation methods on its developers.

__plotly__ even respects transformations that remove attributes used to track visual properties and data mappings. To demonstrate, in the example below, we plot the raw time series with `plot_ly()`, fit a local polynomial regression with `loess()`, obtain the observation-level characteristics of the model with `augment()` from the __broom__ package, layer on the fitted values to the original plot with `add_trace()`, and add a title with `layout()`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(broom)
economics %>%
  transform(rate = unemploy / pop) %>%
  plot_ly(x = date, y = rate, name = "raw") %>%
  loess(rate ~ as.numeric(date), data = .) %>%
  augment() %>%
  add_trace(y = .fitted, name = "smooth") %>%
  layout(title = "Proportion of U.S. population that is unemployed")
```

![](plotly.png)

To make this possible, a special environment within __plotly__'s namespace tracks not only visual mappings/properties, but also the order in which they are specified. So, if a __plotly__ function used to modify a visualization (e.g., `add_trace()` or `layout()`) receives a data frame without any special attributes, it retrieves the last plot created, and modifies that plot. 

__animint__ and __plotly__ could be classified as general purpose software for web-based interactive and dynamic statistical graphics; whereas __LDAvis__, could be classified as software for solving a domain specific problem. The __LDAvis__ package creates an interactive web-based visualization of a topic model fit to a corpus of text data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to assist in interpretation of topics. The visualization itself is written entirely with `HTML5` technologies and makes use of the `JavaScript` library d3js [@Bostock:2011] to implement advanced interaction techniques that higher-level tools such as __plotly__, __animint__, and/or __shiny__ do not currently support.

# Scope

This section describes work to be achieved before completion of the thesis. Most of the work involves writing and revising papers. I have a very early start on two papers that will summarize modern interfaces in R for interactive web graphics as well as curating data on the web.

Toby Dylan Hocking, Susan VanderPlas, and I have a paper in progress which outlines the design of __animint__ and it's interesting features <https://github.com/tdhock/animint-paper/>. We've submitted this paper to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, and were told to revise and resubmit. We intend on revising and submitting to the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics by January 2016. The revision includes a restructuring of the content/ideas and new features implemented during Google Summer of Code 2015. The paper will be included as one of the chapters in my thesis.

We have a long [TODO list](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/blob/4257e8cf76eb5021a98010b6629b779a4f383b24/NEWS#L1-L177) with known bugs and features we'd like to implement in __animint__ after we submit to JCGS. As of writing, I'm working on numerous bug fixes in __plotly__, introduced by a massive reworking of __ggplot2__ internals in version 1.1. I intended on making similar fixes for __animint__ so users can rely on the CRAN version of __ggplot2__, rather than [our fork on GitHub](https://github.com/tdhock/animint). This work simply ensures packages are _usable_, but I'm also interested in expanding the scope of __animint__, which may lead to paper(s) after the thesis is submitted:

1. The current design of __animint__ requires pre-computation of every state the visualization can possibly take on. One benefit of this approach is that we don't need any special software besides a web browser for viewing, and bodes well for cognostic-like applications, but when the number of states is very large, pre-computation can take a long time, and the amount of data that the browser tries to upload can be very large. Instead of pre-computing these states, we could dynamically compute states, only when user requests them, using a HTTP requests. The __plumbr__ and __opencpu__ packages assist in creating a REST API providing the ability to execute arbitrary R functions over HTTP, allowing us to define endpoints at compile time, create/destroy them during the rendering/viewing stage, and all of this could be done on a viewer's machine if R is installed. This addition to __animint__ would be helpful for visualizations with many states, but in order to retain responsiveness, each state would need to be relatively cheap to compute.

2. Integrate crossfilter.js into __animint__. This should help relax current restrictions that summary statistics impose on showing/selecting values. 

In February 2015, I was invited to write a chapter on MLB Pitching Expertise and Evaluation for the Handbook of Statistical Methods for Design and Analysis in Sports, a volume that is planned to be one of the Chapman & Hall/CRC Handbooks of Modern Statistical Methods. I've since brought on Brian Mills as a co-author, and we submitted a draft in early November. This chapter uses data collection and visualization functionality in the __pitchRx__ package, but it more focused on modeling this data with Generalized Additive Models. The book likely won't be published until after this thesis is completed, and the chapter probably won't be included in the thesis, but I do intend on working on revisions of this chapter in the meantime.


# Taming PITCHf/x Data with XML2R and pitchRx

Pitch f/x refers a massive, publicly available baseball dataset hosted on the web in `XML` and `JSON` format. Since this data is large, increases on a daily basis, and only licensed for individual use, the __pitchRx__ package provides a simple interface to download, parse, clean, and transform the data from its source (instead of directly distributing the data). If acquiring large amounts of data, to avoid memory limitations, users may divert incoming data in chunks to a database using any valid R database connection [@DBI]. It also provides a convenient function to update an existing database with the most recently available data.

The __openWAR__ package also provides high-level access to Pitch f/x data, but it is currently more limited in the data it can acquire [@openWAR]. It also currently depends on the difficult to install __Sxslt__ package, impeding portability [@Sxslt]. __openWAR__ depends on __Sxslt__ to help transform XML files to R data frames via XSL Transformations (XSLT). Without advanced knowledge of XSLT, one must define transformations by hard coding assumptions about the XML format, such as the names of fields of interest. New variables have been added into Pitch f/x several times, and __pitchRx__ automatically picks them up, thanks to functionality provided by __XML2R__.

__XML2R__ makes it easy to wrangle relational data stored as a collection of XML files into a list of data frames. Its interface satisfies principles from pure functional programming: the output of each function can be completely determined from the input. The interface is also predictable: each function inputs and outputs a list of observations (an observation is a matrix with one row). It also represents XML content as a list of observations (matrices with one row), allowing each function to operate on native R data structures, making it more intuitive for R programmers to work with compared to the non-native XMLDocumentContent. This new representation is slightly less computationally efficient in some cases, but it has also made it much easier to implement and maintain higher-level interfaces to specific XML data sources, such as __pitchRx__ and __bbscrapeR__ [@bbscrapeR].

# Testing interactive web-based graphics software from R

The current trend in web-based interactive statistical graphics is provide various language bindings to `JavaScript` charting libraries. To test whether the entire software stack is working as intended, it's common to verify properties of the data sent to the binding, but this does not guarantee that the end result is what we expect. A proper testing framework for this type of software should be able to construct and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using technologies available to modern web browsers. To our knowledge, __animint__ is the first R package to implement this testing approach, and some of the lessons learned could be used to construct a more reliable and easier to use testing suite.

<!--
The __animint__ package uses __RSelenium__ in order to test whether visualizations render correctly in a web browser. When I started on __animint__, we were only testing the R code that compiles __ggplot2__ objects as `JSON` objects, but had no way to programmatically test the `JavaScript` code that takes the `JSON` as input. If __animint__ were limited to static web-based graphics, we could use the lighter-weight __rdom__ for testing, but we need to simulate user actions to verify animations and interactive features work as expected.
