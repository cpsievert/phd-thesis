# Two new keywords for interactive, animated plot design: clickSelects and showSelected

This paper explains the clickSelects/showSelected paradigm, implemented in __animint__, which makes it easy to select/query points belonging to arbitrary group(s) and visualize those points in another data space. This differs from the classical linked brushing approach where points must belong to contiguous regions within a subset of the data space.
