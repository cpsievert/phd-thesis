\specialchapt{ABSTRACT}

The following describes a collection of software interfaces for data acquisiton and visualization. All of these interfaces are freely available as extension packages to the R language and leverage web technologies to achieve accessible, portable, and reproducible workflows. The majority of this work (LDAvis, animint, and plotly) focuses on interactive visualization. These interfaces fall roughly into two categories: (1) domain-specific (LDAvis) and (2) general purpose tools for interactive data visualization (animint and plotly). More specifially, the LDAvis package produces an interactive visualization to aid interpretation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model output. The animint and plotly packages are more general, and build upon principles from the grammar of graphics, but extend those principles in slightly different ways to enable interactivity, such as animation and brushing a scatterplot matrix.
