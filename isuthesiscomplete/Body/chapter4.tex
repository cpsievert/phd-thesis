\chapter{RESULTS}

This is the opening paragraph to my thesis which
explains in general terms the concepts and hypothesis
which will be used in my thesis.

With more general information given here than really
necessary.

\section{Introduction}

Here initial concepts and conditions are explained and
several hypothesis are mentioned in brief.

Of course, data on this as seen in Table~\ref{data}
is few and far between.

\begin{tabular}{lcc} \hline
\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Control} & \textbf{Experimental} \\ \hline
Moon Rings & 1.23 & 3.38 \\
Moon Tides & 2.26 & 3.12 \\
Moon Walk & 3.33 & 9.29 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Hypothesis}

Here one particular hypothesis is explained in depth
and is examined in the light of current literature.

Or graphically as seen in Figure~\ref{mgraph}
it is certain that my hypothesis is true.

\subsubsection{Parts of the second hypothesis}

leading to a foregone conclusion.
