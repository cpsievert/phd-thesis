### Tidbits from [@viewing-pipeline].

> Two strong reasons why motion graphics is superior to static plots for many cognitive tasks:
    * Smooth transistions between images allow us to recognize objects as the same across changing views, i.e., objects retain their identity in our perception (see also object constancy -- http://bost.ocks.org/mike/constancy/); whereas exposure to disconnected, still images present the task of identifying objects across pictures.
    * The speed of moving points can convey information in addition to location
    
> As real-time manipulation of plots becomes more widespread, the sophication of users has to grow, as well as the awareness of new possibilities on the side of the implementers.
